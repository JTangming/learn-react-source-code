## What Dilithium Hasn't Covered

As it is a simplest implementation of React, it leaves out a lot of features of it. Below are something that it hasn't covered (This is originally shown in the React Rally talk by Paul in 2016):

* `defaultProps`
* `propTypes`
* `keys`
* `refs`
* batching
* events
* createClass
* warnings
* browser
* optimizations
* rendering null
* DOM updates
* SVG
* life cycle hooks
* error boundaries
* perf tooling and optimizing
* `PureComponents`
* functional components

## Disclaimers

1. Most code of Dilithium you've seen in this repo is originally written by [@zpao](), but it's also slightly changed here.

2. The diffing algorithm used in the Dilithium is the stack reconcilliation, not the new fiber architecture.
